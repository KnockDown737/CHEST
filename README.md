# Hi

# Actually, i'm just a begginer, and taking all the time i have to learn html/css/js and a lot more... 
#
# So, all my codes probably could be broken or even worse, although I'll do my best to fix them. The main point it's not just
# getting the project done, but also learn everything you have seen and typed.

# to sum up, this is just the start of the race and my carrer. I hope that in few years I can be more stronger than today.

#(this will stay as a chest for my experiences XD )
